Oden is an attempt to make a python/tornado social network server
that is able to connect to the diaspora network.

Note that this isn't in any way related to Diaspora, it's just a 
proof of concept of my own.

Also note that this is reeeeaaaaly early stuff, only basic 
functionality for creating a user, logging in etc is done.
 
Any contributions is greatly appreciated! :)
